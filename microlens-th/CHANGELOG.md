# 0.4.2.4

* Exported internal utilities in `Lens.Micro.TH.Internal`.
* Started using `TemplateHaskellQuotes` on GHC 8.0 and newer, thus making it possible to use microlens-th without full Template Haskell support.
* Removed `-f inlining` (now we always do inlining).
* Marked modules as trustworthy.

# 0.4.2.3

* Bumped template-haskell version.

# 0.4.2.2

* Bumped containers version.

# 0.4.2.1

* Fixed [lens bug #799](https://github.com/ekmett/lens/issues/799) (`makeFields` instances violate coverage condition).

# 0.4.2

* We now depend on `th-abstraction` (like `lens` itself).
* Associated types are now supported.

# 0.4.1.3

* Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell again.

# 0.4.1.2

Skipped (the tarball got corrupted).

# 0.4.1.1

* Bumped the upper bound of template-haskell, as requested by @ocharles.

# 0.4.1.0

* Added `abbreviatedFields`.

# 0.4.0.1

* Ported a lens commit that (probably) makes lens generation deterministic. See [issue #83](https://github.com/monadfix/microlens/issues/83).

# 0.4.0.0

* Added `makeClassy` (and `createClass`).

# 0.3.0.2

* Added forgotten copyright/authorship information.

# 0.3.0.1

* The library is now compatible with GHC 8.

# 0.3.0.0

* `SimpleGetter` and `SimpleFold` are no longer reexported.

# 0.2.2.0

* Moved `Getter` and `Fold` from this package to microlens (they're in `Lens.Micro.Extras`).

# 0.2.1.3

* Bumped template-haskell (so that the package would compile with GHC HEAD).

# 0.2.1.2

* Bumped microlens version to be able to use `phantom`.

# 0.2.1.1

* Bumped microlens version again.

# 0.2.1.0

* Bumped base version.
* Bumped microlens version.

# 0.2.0.0

* `createClass` was removed because it doesn't seem to be useful without `lensClass`.
* `defaultFieldRules` isn't exported anymore â€“ use `camelCaseFields`.

# 0.1.2.0

* Package now compiles with `-O2` and other optimisations by default.

# 0.1.1.0

* Added `makeLensesFor` (and `lensRulesFor`).
